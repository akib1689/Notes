# How to install pi-hole on Ubuntu with Docker

## Introduction

[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) is a network-wide ad blocker that improves your internet experience by blocking ads, trackers, and malware. It is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, but it can also be installed on other devices, such as a Linux server or a virtual machine.

This guide will walk through the process of installing Pi-hole on an Ubuntu 22.04 server using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need the following:

- A system running Ubuntu 22.04
- A user account with `sudo` privileges
- Docker installed on your system. if you don't have Docker installed, you can follow our guide on [how to install Docker on Ubuntu](../linux-administration/install-docker.md).


## Installing Pi-hole with Docker

To install Pi-hole with Docker, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for Pi-hole and navigate to it:

   ```bash
   mkdir pihole
   cd pihole
   ```
1. Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` and open it in a text editor:

   ```bash
   nano docker-compose.yml
   ```

1. Add the following content to the `docker-compose.yml` file:

   ```yaml
   version: "3"

    # More info at https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/ and https://docs.pi-hole.net/
    services:
    pihole:
        container_name: pihole
        image: pihole/pihole:latest
        # For DHCP it is recommended to remove these ports and instead add: network_mode: "host"
        ports:
        - "53:53/tcp"
        - "53:53/udp"
        - "67:67/udp" # Only required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server
        - "80:80/tcp"
        environment:
        TZ: 'Asia/Dhaka'
        WEBPASSWORD: 'SECUER_PASSWORD'
        PIHOLE_DNS_: '8.8.8.8;8.8.4.4'
        # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
        volumes:
        - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
        - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
        #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
        cap_add:
        - NET_ADMIN # Required if you are using Pi-hole as your DHCP server, else not needed
        restart: unless-stopped

    ```
    This `docker-compose.yml` file defines a service named `pihole` that uses the `pihole/pihole:latest` image. It exposes ports 53, 67, and 8080, and mounts two volumes for persistent data storage.
## Configure Pi-hole

Before saving this file we need to configure the Pi-hole environment variables. 
- `TZ`: Set your timezone. You can find a list of valid timezones [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
- `WEBPASSWORD`: Set a password for the Pi-hole web interface.
- `PIHOLE_DNS_`: Set the DNS servers to be used by Pi-hole. You can specify multiple DNS servers separated by a semicolon.

### Configuring the web admin interface

By default, the web admin interface is accessible on port 80. If you want to change the port, you can modify the `docker-compose.yml` file to use a different port. For example, to use port 8080, change the `80:80/tcp` line to `8080:80/tcp` in the `ports` section.

After the configuration is complete, save the `docker-compose.yml` file and exit the text editor.

## Disabling systemd-resolved (Ubuntu only)

If you are using Ubuntu, you may need to disable the `systemd-resolved` service to prevent conflicts with Pi-hole. To do this, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved
```

The first command wil disable the `systemd-resolved` service from starting automatically at boot, and the second command will stop the service immediately.

With the `systemd-resolved` service disabled, you need to modify the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to use a different DNS server. Open the file in a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Find the line that starts with `nameserver` and the contents of the line should be like this:

```bash
nameserver 127.0.0.53
```

change the `nameserver` to `1.1.1.1` or any other DNS server you want to use. Save the file and exit the text editor. `1.1.1.1` is the Cloudflare DNS server, but you can use any DNS server you prefer.

## Starting the Pi-hole container

After configuring the `docker-compose.yml` file and disabling `systemd-resolved` (if applicable), you can start the Pi-hole container by running the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

make sure you are in the same directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

The `-d` flag tells Docker to run the container in detached mode, which means it will run in the background.

## Accessing the Pi-hole web interface

Once the container is running, you can access the Pi-hole web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://<server-ip>` or `http://<server-ip>:<port-number>` if you changed the port.

You will be prompted to log in with the password you set in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The admin login prompt looks like this:

After logging in, you can configure Pi-hole settings, view statistics, and manage your ad-blocking lists.

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed Pi-hole on your Ubuntu server using Docker. You can now use Pi-hole to block ads, trackers, and malware on your network. For more information on how to use Pi-hole, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/).
